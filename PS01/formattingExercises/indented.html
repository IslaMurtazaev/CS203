    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While computer programming can be a great tool used to achieve many things, there are
    a few misconceptions when it comes to the subject, a few misconceptions that should be cleared up. One misconception
    about computer programming is that you would need to have some kind of special software to write programs - this is hardly
    the case.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computer programming is defined as telling a computer what to do through a special set
    of instructions which are then interpreted by the computer to perform some task(s). These instructions can be specified
    in one or more programming languages including (but not limited to) Java, PHP, C, and C++. A computer goes through a
    series of steps whose purpose is to achieve something - a series of steps that are instructed to it in great detail by
    computer programs. Essentialy, computer programming is the process by which these programs are designed and implemented.
